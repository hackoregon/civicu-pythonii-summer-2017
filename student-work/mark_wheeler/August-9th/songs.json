choice to run off or defendMust punish to win gotta let that gun off for ya kinThe only laws is 'no laws at all' once it beginsFrom the smell of blood violence is absorbed into the skinAnd the thoughts of kids caught up should torture people to deathNow freedoms with them see if they morph and see any senseCan you picture a little boy dragging wood down the lane?Grandma waiting for him

painted a little more like George Gittoes doJaded because we didn't hear them calls coming throughHow we'd savor our days if we had to walk in them shoesCountries can't build without support for the youthThey lost when their most important resources abusedForming our views and not picking up on the cuesInner-city blues stop many from listening to the cluesVoices on mute so we whisper this to youNo time for school many children be enlisted to be troopsAnd we walk  thinking that the system got us screwedLike we taught just to keep a short distance from the truthWhen scores\\u2026are born only to be drifting to a nooseWhen they gone well be saying  lord forgive we never knewGotta question why many got there scriptures misconstruedAnd why spending on weapons and not assistance is the ruleCan you picture a little boy dragging wood down the lane?Grandma waiting for him brother playing outside in the rainEach day we hear the score before not after shots of warAnd the road to him is love but the love is never moreWe're caught up in the pictures that they have shown usAnd not the millions of innocents that been blown upCold hearts disconnecting us from our own bloodFor their objectives its best that they blindfold usCan you picture a little boy dragging wood down the lane?Grandma waiting for him brother playing outside in the rainWe're caught up in the pictures that they have shown usAnd not the millions of innocents that been blown upCold hearts disconnecting us from our own bloodFor their objectives its best that they blindfold usCan you picture a little boy

lost souls looking for ways to entertain their brain?Couldn't strain friendships and made it hardTo go against the grainOn a lonely road where no one is on a quest for changeTo get control then at best you must confess todayBarely a cent after rent in a mess you staySavings are spent invested in the stress and decayDo we rest the blame on the shoulders of society?Who let it creep through although they know its notoriety?If I could take your past and hold it where your eyes can seeTo show you've joined a long lineThat be folding up them brightest dreamsSometimes the city can suck you in to its habitsWhere it's easier to sink than to manageLet it goSometimes even the loudest people in a crowded placeFeel drowned out and start to think they're aloneAnother day another broken dreamWe
