""" 
The goal of this challenge is to create a function that will take a list of 
names and a bin size and then shuffle those names and return them in a 
list of lists where the length of the inner lists matches the bin size. 

For example calling the function with a list of names and the size of 2 should return 
a list of lists where each inner list has 2 random names. If the the number
of names provided doesn't divide evenly into the bin size and only one name is 
remaining add that name to another inner list.
