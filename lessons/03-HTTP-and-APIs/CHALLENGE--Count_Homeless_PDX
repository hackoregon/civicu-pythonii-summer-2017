# *CHALLENGE*: Count the Homeless in Portland

Here's a start at a loop that "exercises" the civicu API.

```python
import json
import requests

for i in range(2000, 2015):
    url = 'http://service.civicpdx.org/homeless/ethnicity/?format=json&page=1&year={}'.format(i)
    print(url)
    r = requests.get(url)
    print(r.status_code)
    print(json.dump(json.loads(r.content.decode()), indent=2))
```

1) load the json from a civicpdx.org response into a list or dictionary
2) extract an integer from it for the "count" of homeless people in a shelter for each year in your loop,
3) sum up all those counts for all the years in civicpdx

If you want extra credit make sure you haven't missed any homeless people.

If you want extra double-secret credit make sure you haven't double-counted any any homeless people.

which years did we do the homeless survey in Portland?

Do you notice any trends or patterns?
