# *CHALLENGE*: Command Line Script

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write and install a command line script that changes your wallpaper image!

If your operating system makes it difficult to mess with the wall paper image file, then just display an image with your command line app, or have it say something random and funny or inspiring each time you run it.

1. Locate the file where your wallpaper image is stored on your system and copy it's path
2. Replace it with a new one by hand from the command prompt
3. Trigger a "refresh" of your wallpaper (you may have to log out and then back in)
4. Figure out how to do all that in python (try not to use system OS calls unless you have to)
5. Test your script by hand from the bash prompt
6. Add your script to the setup.cfg
7. Install or reinstall your package
8. Check that you can run your command line script from any folder/path/directory on your computer
