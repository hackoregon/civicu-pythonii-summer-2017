#### [`setup.cfg`](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#setup-cfg)

*.cfg files are also called INI files. INI files are those configuration/settings files that contain sections and a list of setting values. The INI format is a [`declarative`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Python is an [_imparative_ or _procedural_ language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming).

- What is a DSL?
- What is a "declarative" language?
- What is a "procedural" or "imperative" language?


DSLs are special-purpose languages that are designed and undertstood by all experts in a domain (like Automotive Manufacture, Database Design, Software Design, etc) for a specific, constrained environment, like document or image rendering, or database schema and query definition.

##### Example DSLs:

- markup languages: markdown, HTML, XML, JSON?, CSV?, *.CFG, *.INI, natural language grammar diagramming/tagging (SyntaxNet)
- model and data-specification languages: Ansible yml files, Puppet language, Makefile, *.dot, regex, Swagger API schema definition, `man` and `--help` grammar syntax

DB schema languages, like SQL, CASE, and even UML (universal modeling language), are too general-purpose to be considered domain-specific (I think).

##### Example Declarative Languages

- Puppet Lang (ruby+)
- Ansible *.yml files
- INI/config files
- SQL (sort-of)
- JSON (sort-of)

##### Example Procedural and OO Languages

- Python
- Ruby
- C++

##### Working with INI files (like `setup.cfg`) in python

To load a *.cfg or *.ini file, we use the configparser package built into Python.

```python
import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read('FILE.INI')
print(config['DEFAULT']['path'])
```

Unlike json, I haven't found a way to convert a config object into a `list` or `dict` except by usinge the `__dict__` attribute.

To update a 'path' configuration parameter in the _DEFAULT_ section of your `config` you would do something like...

```python
config['DEFAULT']['path'] = '/var/shared/'
config['DEFAULT']['default_message'] = 'Hey! help me!!'   # creatâ€¦
```


#### [Releasing a Package](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/)



We won't do this until after we have some documentation and code, but here's how you can share your awesome new app with the python world.

```bash
$ git tag -a 0.0.1 -m 'Release of version 0.0.1 does awesome new stuff!'
$ git push --tag
$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal upload  # INSECURE!!!
```

But that would send a GET and POST requests to *http://*pypi.python.org rather than *https://*! So your packets could be intercepted by the router, or if you're on an unencrypted WiFi connection, anyone on the same WIFI connection!  I'm not sure how hard it is to intercept and decrypt your packets on a password-protected encrypted WiFi network (e.g. WPA2 connection), but better safe than sorry, *especially* if you use the same password at _pypi_ as elsewhere.

```bash
$ pip install twine
$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal
$ twine upload build/*.tgz
```

[Twine](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine) uses SSL for the connection and is configurable with environment variables in addition to a pypirc file. 

To avoid having to enter your pypi credentials every time you interact with pypi, save something like this to the `~/.pypirc` file:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
repository: https://www.python.org/pypi
username: $PYPI_USER
password: $PYPI_PASSWORD
```

Delete the `repository` assignment. It's deprecated in python3 and Twine.

#### Installing

A python package can be installed from a source code path, or .tar.gz or .tgz (tar and gzip bundle) file (which is a wheel). And it can automatically find that wheel if it's registered with pypi and uploaded.

```bash
$ pip install -e path/to/your/python_package/

$ sudo pip install -e path/to/your/python_package/

$ pip install python_package

$ cd python_package
$ python setup.py install

$ cd python_package
$ python setup.py build
$ python 

```

_PyScaffold_ makes it easy to create and install a command line app (like grep or ls or django-admin) with a python package.
Look in `setup.cfg` for a skeleton command line app and the example `skeleton.py` file.

### Docs

- What are docstrings?
	- What do RST docstrings look like?
	- What do Google-style docstrings look like? [RTD](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
	- Which do you prefer?
- Can docstrings produce docs?
- What is Sphinx?
- What is docs/config.py?

Another convention that I find useful is to always use single quotes for 'string's that are intended for a machine and would break your code if they didn't precisely match what the code expects. "Double quotes" are used for all other strings, typically natural language names and phrases that have a lot of different forms that would work in your code.

### Tests

- What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?
- What is Conference-Driven Development (CDD)?
- What is D&D?
- What is a Unittest?
- What is an Integration Test or E2E (EndToEnd) Test?
- What is Travis?
- What is Tox?
- What is Continuous Integration?
- How do you run tests on a python app?
- How do you run tests on a Django app?
- How can you test web pages?
- How can you test APIs?
- What database or "environment" do your tests use?

Integration testing is hard, and requires a complete E2E app to be useful. But some people argue that they are the only tests you need. I find that unittests are very valuable for functions and classes that are the foundation for something bigger. They are especially important if the wrong output will not trigger an obvious error down the road.

That brings us to a best-practice for Exceptions in web applications. Web applications should minimize the use of `try:`...`except:` blocks, especially "bare" except blocks that will vacuum up *ALL* errors in your code. This is because we want to discover bugs during testing and fix them before they cause unexpected or erroneous behavior for users. Exceptions will log themselves to a log file in a web application rather than hiding themselve and present some default value to the user.  Imagine if, when making a withdrawal from an online ATM or a transfer at a banking web app and you attempted to use a value that wasn't valid (like Euros at a US bank). If that exception were "caught" and a default withdrawal of $0.00 was issued to your account and provided to you, you would be confused. Even more confusing if it assumed that you wanted it to convert those Euros to dollars and withdrew that new, larger amount.
