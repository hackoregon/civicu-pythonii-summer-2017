### 3 Code Challenges

Programming assignment with 10 discrete "features" (behaviors).
All of these behaviors will be present in my labeler app or the `lessons/` folder, for your use as a pattern.
There will be several ways to solve each of these 3 problems.
You can use brute force or elegant data structures.
As long as it works you'll get full credit.

The features will check your understanding of:

- loops and iterables
- conditionals
- list comprehension
- coercion
- classes
- functions
- a CSV file
- a JSON string
- a django View
- a command line script
- `*args`
- `**kwargs`
- `dict`s, `list`s, `tuple`s, `OrderedDict`s, `defaultdict`s
- nested data structures (dict of lists of tuple of dict ...)
- `getattr()`
- `.get()`
- `try/except` 
- `tuple`
- `zip`
- `np.array`
- `pd.DataFrame`
- GET request
- Django
- DRF

10 Multiple Choice Questions about fundamentals of python.
You're not allowed to Google, but you are allowed to use all the resources and code installed on your machine.
It will test all of the concepts above plus some of these below.

- `%` as a string interpolator
- float vs int
- coercion and dynamic typing
- *args and **kwargs
- PEP8
- Django MTV architecture and how everything fits together

# Advanced

Bonus questions may cover things like

- `and`/`or` vs `&`/`|`
- `np.array` vs python `list`
- NaNs vs Nones
- `%` (mod) as a binary math operator
