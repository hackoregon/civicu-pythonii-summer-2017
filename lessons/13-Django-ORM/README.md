- exercism 9: [bob](../../student-work/hobson_lane/exercism/python/bob/README.md)
- exercism 10: [run-length-encoding](../../student-work/hobson_lane/exercism/python/run-length-encoding/README.md)

## Testing

- [Doctests](../12-Testing-and-Deployment/testing.md#doctests)
- [codecov.io](../12-Testing-and-Deployment/testing.md#dodecov)

I discovered Codecov by clicking on a badge in another repo.
If popular python packages that have a lot of recent activity (currenlty maintained and not stale) are using a tool, it's usually worth checking out.

## [Django ORM](django-orm.md)

- `QuerySet`
- `ModelManager`
- `count()`
- `filter()`
- `annotate`
- `aggregate`

## [Deployment](../12-Testing-and-Deployment/deployment.md)
