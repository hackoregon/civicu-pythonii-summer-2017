# Weekly Class Homework for Python II

## Resources

* Python Virtual Env: [Virtual Environments](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
* Python Virtualenvwrapper: [Virtual Environments](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Anaconda Virtual Env: [Conda Virtual Environments](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html)


## Homework description: 

This past week we spent some time working with virtual environments. The term Virtual Environments refers to many
types of technologies but our focus this week was on the Python based "virtualenv". The creation of python based virtual 
environments allow you to install various packages needed to complete a specific job, helps manage package dependency,
and reduces system conflicts. This weeks homework assignment will demonstrate how this works and help to increase 
your fluency with virtual environment concepts.


## Homework objectives:
  
1. Install or confirm the installation of a python based virtual environment.

   (For those of you using Anaconda refer to material and commands specific to your implementation)
   
2. Confirm version of virtaulenv package.

3. Create virtual environment <venv-1>, activate, install flask

4. Create virtual environment <venv-2>, activate, install django

5. Create virtual environment <venv-3> installed w/ Python 2.7x , activate, install pandas

6. For each environment show the installed python packages

7. Remove all traces of a single virtual environment

8. Find a virtual environment cheat sheet you like and share something you learned.

Optional: Research additional virtual environment functionality through packages like 
virtualwrapper and Anaconda

(hint: Be careful not to nest your environments)
